Hex maps for ICS using Simple Features

A markdown file and necessary csv files to build hexmpas of ICS. 

A bit of a dump I am afraid  - need to tidy it up.

# What is the purpose of this blog? 

I am going to introduce how to use Simple Features to look at creating bespoke maps using co-ordinate system grids. 


# What is the problem? 

It all started with trying to do a map of ICS to show variation but being flummoxed by the different size of each of them. London is always swamped or has to be mapped seperately, and North East always draws the eye as it is so big.
